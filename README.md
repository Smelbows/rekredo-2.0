# Rekredo 2.0

In 2021 I completed the Technigo bootcamp, creating Rekredo as a final project with Jakob Lindström (jakobxlindstrom) and Lousanne Lundström (loulunds). This is a remake of that project, for me to play with some new tools, and to show what my code looks like now compared to when I finished studying.

## About Rekredo

Rekredo is a marketplace site where individuals can loan out their antiques or novel items and props departments can source authentic pieces for their productions all in one place.
